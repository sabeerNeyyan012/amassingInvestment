  GDP: `
    <p>The value of the goods and services produced in the United States is the gross domestic product. The percentage that GDP grew (or shrank) from one period to another is an important way for Americans to gauge how their economy is doing. The United States' GDP is also watched around the world as an economic barometer.</p>
<p>GDP is the signature piece of BEA's National Income and Product Accounts, which measure the value and makeup of the nation's output, the types of income generated, and how that income is used.</p>
<p>BEA also estimates GDP for states, metropolitan areas, counties, and U.S. territories. We publish GDP by industry, as well.</p>
<h5>What can you do with GDP numbers?</h5>
<p>Answer questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
How fast is the U.S. economy growing?
</li>
<li>
How does my state's economy stack up against others?
</li>
<li>
Which industries are growing? Which are slowing?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The White House and Congress use GDP numbers to plan spending and tax policy. The Federal Reserve uses them when setting monetary policy. State and local governments rely on GDP numbers, too. Business people use these stats when making decisions about jobs, expansion, investments, and more.</p>
  `,
  realGDP: `<p>Real gross domestic product (real GDP) is an inflation-adjusted measure that reflects the value of all goods and services produced by an economy in a given year (expressed in base-year prices) and is often referred to as constant-price GDP, inflation-corrected GDP, or constant dollar GDP. </p>
    <h5>Understanding Real GDP</h5>
    <p>Real GDP is a macroeconomic statistic that measures the value of the goods and services produced by an economy in a specific period, adjusted for inflation. Essentially, it measures a country's total economic output, adjusted for price changes. </p>
    <p>Governments use both nominal and real GDP as metrics for analyzing economic growth and purchasing power over time. This is done using the GDP price deflator (also called the implicit price deflator), which measures the changes in prices for all of the goods and services produced in an economy.</p>
    <p>The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) provides a quarterly report on GDP with headline data statistics representing real GDP levels and real GDP growth.1 Nominal GDP is also included in the BEA’s quarterly report under the name current dollar. Unlike nominal GDP, real GDP accounts for changes in price levels and provides a more accurate figure of economic growth.</p>
  
  `,
  nominalPotentialGDP: `<p>Potential gross domestic product (GDP) is a theoretical concept that means different things to different people. To some, it reflects a world in which every worker is matched with the perfect job, every good idea is implemented, and the bad ones are ignored. In this world, resources are allocated optimally with no distortions from the tax code, information frictions, or suboptimal government policies. </p>
<p>But this theoretical "perfect world" is not the real world, and the scenario just described is not the concept of potential GDP monetary policymakers typically use when setting monetary policy. Instead, they estimate potential GDP by constructing measures of the trend in actual GDP that smooth out business cycle fluctuations. Looking back in time, potential output is relatively easy to measure because we have reliable methods to extract smooth trends from historical data. However, measuring potential output in real time is more difficult because only past data are available to estimate the trend. We cannot be confident about the estimate of potential GDP for 2012 until several years have passed and we see how GDP evolves—the accuracy of our estimate depends on the accuracy of our long-term forecast. </p>
<p>But why does potential GDP matter? How do we use it? Potential GDP is important because monetary policymakers use the difference between actual and potential GDP—the output gap—to determine whether the economy needs more or less monetary stimulus. One look at recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) data shows how much estimates of the output gap can change as time passes. According to CBO estimates of potential GDP, U.S. actual GDP fell about 10 percent short of potential during 2009:Q1. Since then, actual GDP has paralleled the potential GDP series forecast made by economists back in 2007—but, of course, along a considerably lower level path. The chart shows logged values of actual GDP and two estimates of potential GDP calculated by the CBO. The higher level of potential GDP was estimated in 2007 and the lower level in 2011. The reduced 2011 estimate reflects the impact of sluggish GDP growth over the past three years. </p>
<p>Based on revised estimates, we can now calculate the 2009:Q1 output gap to be –7.1 percent. Even more interesting is how the revision affects estimates of the output gap for 2011:Q4. If we use 2007 estimates, the output gap for 2011:Q4 would be –11.3 percent. When we use up-to-date estimates, the gap is much smaller: only –5.6%. Potential GDP is likely to be revised downward again if (i) growth remains moderate—say, less than 3 percent—and (ii) inflation continues to edge upward. </p>
<p>Continued moderate growth of GDP is forecast over the next few years. In the minutes of the January Federal Open Market Committee meeting, the participants projected, on average, that real GDP would grow about 3 percent over the next three calendar years. This growth rate is too slow to get GDP back to current estimates of the trend. If the projections hold true, the estimates of the level of potential GDP will fall even further. This pessimistic outlook is also supported by Keynesian (and New Keynesian) theory, which predicts that a negative output gap should lead to falling inflation. But instead, we have seen a modest rise in inflation. If the theory is correct, the gap may be closing faster than we thought because potential GDP is lower than we thought. And, if potential GDP is lower than expected, then interest rates may have to rise sooner than expected to prevent an acceleration of inflation. </p>

  realGDPPerCapita: `<p>The formula for real GDP per capita depends on what data you have available. Let's start with the simplest. If you already know real GDP (R), then you divide it by the population (C): </p>
<p>R/C = real GDP per capita. </p>
<p>In the United States, the Bureau of Economic Analysis calculates real GDP using 2012 as the base year.</p>
<p>If you don't know real GDP, you can calculate it from nominal GDP (N) if you know the implicit price deflator (D). The deflator is the ratio of what goods and services would cost today if there had been no inflation since the base year. It's similar to another measure of inflation, the Consumer Price Index. Its components are weighted differently. </p>
<p>Fortunately, the BEA provides the deflator for 2012 in Table 1.1.9.4 Here's the formula to calculate real GDP per capita (R) if you only know nominal GDP (N) and the deflator (D)</p>
<p>(N/D) / C = real GDP per capita </p>
<p>The best way to calculate real GDP per capita for the United States is to use the real GDP estimates already published by the BEA. Then just divide it by the population. Fortunately, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis already calculated it, as shown below. </p>
`,
  federalFunds: `<p>The term federal funds rate refers to the target interest rate set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). This target is the rate at which commercial banks borrow and lend their excess reserves to each other overnight. The FOMC, which is the policymaking body of the Federal Reserve System, meets eight times a year to set the target federal funds rate, which is part of its monetary policy. This is used to help promote economic growth.
</p>
<h5>Understanding the Federal Funds Rate</h5>
<p>The federal funds rate refers to the interest rate that banks charge other institutions for lending excess cash to them from their reserve balances on an overnight basis.2 By law, banks must maintain a reserve equal to a certain percentage of their deposits in an account at a Federal Reserve bank. The amount of money a bank must keep in its Fed account is known as a reserve requirement and is based on a percentage of the bank's total deposits.3 </p>
<p>Financial institutions are required to maintain interest-bearing accounts at Federal Reserve banks to ensure they have enough money to cover depositors' withdrawals and other obligations.4 Any money in their reserve that exceeds the required level is available for lending to other banks that might have a shortfall.5 </p>
<p>The end-of-the-day balances in the bank's account averaged over two-week reserve maintenance periods are used to determine whether it meets its reserve requirements.3 If a bank expects to have end-of-the-day balances greater than what's required, it can lend the excess to an institution that anticipates a shortfall in its balances. The interest rate the lending bank can charge is the federal funds rate, or fed funds rate.6 </p>
<p>The FOMC makes its decisions about rate adjustments based on key economic indicators that may show signs of inflation, recession, or other issues that can affect sustainable economic growth. The indicators can include measures like the core inflation rate and the durable goods orders report. </p>
<p>The target for the federal funds rate has varied widely over the years in response to the prevailing economic conditions. It was set as high as 20% in the early 1980s in response to inflation. With the coming of the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009, the rate was slashed to a record low target of 0% to 0.25% in an attempt to encourage growth.</p>

  CPI: `<p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the monthly change in prices paid by U.S. consumers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) calculates the CPI as a weighted average of prices for a basket of goods and services representative of aggregate U.S. consumer spending.</p>
<p>The CPI is one of the most popular measures of inflation and deflation. The CPI report uses a different survey methodology, prices sample and index weights than the producer price index (PPI), which measures change in the prices received by U.S. producers of goods and services.</p>
<h5>Understanding the Consumer Price Index (CPI)</h5>
<p>The BLS collects about 94,000 prices monthly from some 23,000 retail and service establishments. Although the two CPI indexes calculated from the data both contain the word urban, the more broad-based and widely cited of the two covers 93% of the U.S. population.</p>
<p>User fees and sales or excise taxes are included, while income taxes and the prices of investments such as stocks, bonds, or life insurance policies are not part of the CPI.2</p>
<p>Shelter category prices accounting for nearly a third of the overall CPI are based on a survey of rental prices for 43,000 housing units, which is then used to calculate the rise in rental prices as well as owners' equivalent.3 The owners' equivalent category models the rent equivalent for owner-occupied housing to properly reflect housing costs' share of consumer spending.</p>
<p>The calculation of the CPI indexes from the data factors in substitution effects&mdash;consumers' tendency to shift spending away from products and categories grown relatively more expensive. It also adjusts price data for changes in product quality and features. The weighting of the product and services categories in the CPI indexes corresponds to recent consumer spending patterns derived from a separate survey.</p>`,
  inflationRate: `<p>The inflation rate is the percentage increase or decrease in prices during a specified period, usually a month or a year. The percentage tells you how quickly prices rose during that period. Gas prices will be 2% higher next year if the inflation rate for a gallon of gas is 2% per year. That means a gallon of gas that costs $2.00 this year will cost $2.04 next year. </p>
  <p>The inflation rate is a critical component of the misery index, which is an economic indicator that helps to determine an average citizen's financial health. The other component is the unemployment rate. People are either suffering from a recession, struggling with inflation, or both when the misery index is higher than 7%.</p>

  unemploymentRate: `
  <p>The unemployment rate is the number of unemployed divided by the number in the civilian labor force. Everyone without a job isn't necessarily unemployed, at least according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. To be counted in the unemployment rate, you not only have to be without a job, you also must have actively looked for work in the past four weeks. If you were temporarily laid off and are waiting to be called back to that job, you're still counted. If you've given up looking for work, you're not counted in the unemployment rate. Many people argue that the real unemployment rate is much higher, since it should count those discouraged workers.</p>
<h5>Understanding the Unemployment Rate</h5>
<p>The U.S. unemployment rate is released on the first Friday of every month (with a few exceptions) for the preceding month. The current and past editions of the report are available on the website of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Users can generate and download tables showing any of the labor market measures named above for a specified date range.n the U.S., the official and the most commonly cited national unemployment rate is the U-3, which the BLS releases as part of its monthly employment situation report. It defines unemployed people as those who are willing and available to work and who have actively sought work within the past four weeks.</p>

  totalNonfarmPayroll: `
<p>Nonfarm payrolls is the measure of the number of workers in the U.S. excluding farm workers and workers in a handful of other job classifications. This is measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which surveys private and government entities throughout the U.S. about their payrolls. The BLS reports the nonfarm payroll numbers to the public on a monthly basis through the closely followed &ldquo;Employment Situation&rdquo; report.</p>
<p>In addition to farm workers, nonfarm payrolls data also excludes some government workers, private households, proprietors, and non-profit employees.</p>
<h5>Understanding the Nonfarm Payrolls</h5>
<ul>
<li>While the name nonfarm payrolls insinuates that farm workers be excluded from the statistic, there are also several other categories that the BLS does not count when compiling nonfarm payrolls data. According to the BLS, nonfarm employee classifications account for approximately 80% of U.S. business sectors contributing to gross domestic product (GDP). While this represents a significant majority of the U.S. labor force there are some notable exclusions in addition to farm workers:</li>
<li>Government workers: Government is a key part of the &ldquo;Employment Situation&rdquo; report each month but there are some government workers who are excluded. The government category covers civilian employees. However, it excludes military employees and employees of government-appointed officials. Employees of the Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, National Imagery and Mapping Agency, and the Defense Intelligence Agency are also excluded.</li>
<li>Private households: Private household employees and domestic household workers are excluded.</li>
<li>Proprietors: Proprietors are generally unincorporated business owners. This includes sole proprietors and self-employed workers that operate without a registered business incorporation (e.g., without limited liability corporation or partnership status).</li>
<li>Non-profit employees: Though quite large, the non-profit sector is not included for consideration in the nonfarm payroll statistics.</li>
</ul>

  initialClaims: `
  <p>Initial claims are new jobless claims filed by U.S. workers seeking unemployment compensation, included in the unemployment insurance weekly claims report. The report, published since 1967, includes a separate count of workers receiving unemployment insurance benefits, known as continuing claims,</p>
<h5>Understanding the Initial Claims</h5>
<p>The initial claims number is used by policymakers in conjunction with other employment data to determine the strength of the labor market. It is also watched closely by financial analysts because it provides insight into the health of the economy. Initial claims typically rise before the economy enters a recession and decline before the economy starts to recover, making them useful as a leading indicator.</p>
<p>The weekly claims report is released Thursdays at 8:30 a.m. ET by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). State workforce agencies gather the data from local unemployment offices, then forward it to the DOL.</p>
<p>First-time claims are reported for the week ended the prior Saturday. Continuing claims in the report are for the week ended 12 days earlier. Initial claims are reported both on a nominal and a seasonally adjusted basis. The report also provides four-week moving averages for both initial and continuing claims.</p>
<p>First-time claims numbers can be volatile, subject to distortions for a variety of reasons including holidays and weather. They don't provide the comprehensive picture of the labor market presented in the DOL's monthly employment report.</p>
<p>Initial claims do provide more frequent data points indicating the trend in layoffs based on the recent decisions of U.S. employers. The layoffs trend can be particularly telling at economic turning points.</p>

  retailSales: `
  <p>The term retail sales refers to an economic metric that tracks consumer demand for finished goods. This figure is a very important data set as it is a key monthly market-moving event. Retail sales are reported each month by the U.S. Census Bureau and indicate the direction of the economy. It acts as a key economic barometer and whether inflationary pressures exist. Retail sales are measured by durable and non-durable goods purchased over a defined period of time. Sales for the report are derived from 13 types of retailers from foodservice to retail stores.</p>
<h5>Understanding the Retail Sales</h5>
<p>Retail sales are a good indicator of the pulse of the economy and its projected path toward expansion or contraction. Retail sales figures are reported by all foodservice and retail stores and compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau. The measurement is typically based on data sampling and is used to model the patterns for the entire country.</p>
<p>As a leading macroeconomic indicator, healthy retail sales figures typically elicit positive movements in equity markets. Higher sales are good news for shareholders of retail companies because it means higher earnings. Bondholders, on the other hand, are quite ambivalent towards this metric. A booming economy is good for all, but lower retail sales figures and a contracting economy would translate to a decrease in inflation. This may cause investors to gravitate toward bonds, eventually leading to higher bond prices.</p>
<p>Major changes in price can affect retail sales figures. These fluctuations in prices are seen primarily in two retail sales categories: food retailers and gas stations. Large increases in food and energy prices can cause sales figures to drop in both categories, thus affecting the sales of a particular month.</p>

  consumerSentiment: `
 <p>Consumer sentiment is a statistical measurement of the overall health of the economy as determined by consumer opinion. It takes into account people's feelings toward their current financial health, the health of the economy in the short-term, and the prospects for longer-term economic growth, and is widely considered to be a useful economic indicator.</p>
<p>Consumer sentiment emerged as an economic statistic during the mid-20th century and has since become a barometer that influences public and economic policy.</p>
<h5>Understanding the Consumer Sentiment</h5>
<p>In the U.S., consumer spending makes up a majority of economic output. As much as 70% of gross domestic product (GDP) is driven by a consumer spending component, so the sentiment or attitude of consumers goes a long way in gauging the health of the economy. The other main drivers of GDP are business investments, government spending, and net exports.1</p>
<p>If people are confident about the future they are likely to shop more, boosting the economy. In contrast, when consumers are uncertain about what lies ahead, they tend to save money and make fewer discretionary purchases. Gloomy sentiment weakens demand for goods and services, impacting corporate investment, the stock market, and employment opportunities, among other things.</p>
<p>Very bullish consumer sentiment can also be bad for the economy. When people buy lots of goods and services prices can rise significantly, leading to an unwelcome rise in inflation. To stamp out inflation, central banks hike interest rates, which leads to an increase in borrowing costs for both consumers and businesses. This tends to slow economic growth and weigh on exports&mdash;higher interest rates strengthen the value of currencies.</p>

  durableGoods: `
  
  <p dir="ltr"><span>Durable goods are expensive items that you can expect to last for three years or more. Businesses and consumers only buy these big-ticket items when they feel confident about the economy. They put off buying durable goods until things get better when they're not sure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) measures durable goods as part of its quarterly U.S. </span><span>gross domestic product</span><span> report. It's an important </span><span>component of GDP</span><span>. The BEA releases the current GDP statistics report for each quarter.</span></p>
<h5 dir="ltr"><span>Understanding the Durable Goods</span></h5>
<p dir="ltr">Durable goods (also called durables) can be used for a long time, and customers don&rsquo;t have to purchase them often. In general, if employed correctly for either individual or business purposes, they can serve their owner for years. This type of goods includes cars, appliances, office furniture, garden equipment, electronics, motorcycles, jewelry, and more. It&rsquo;s essential to know how exactly durables differ from other goods, so let&rsquo;s review their characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">such goods have a long life cycle (more than three years);</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">they don&rsquo;t wear out or break down quickly, so people don&rsquo;t have to purchase them frequently;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">they can be used many times;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">these goods can be expensive, and that&rsquo;s why many people rent them instead of purchasing them;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">an increase in orders of durables signifies that the economy is getting better (i.e., consumers purchase durables when they know that the economy is improving);</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">customers sometimes rely on bank loans to buy these items because of their high price;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">the process of purchasing these products usually requires careful planning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Durables can be divided into two groups that include consumer durable goods and business durable goods.</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Consumer durable goods.</span><span> This group refers to goods bought by individuals or households with the hope that these products will serve them for years so that they don&rsquo;t need to buy them again soon. Examples include cars, furniture, electronics, books, tables, chairs, etc.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-51802760-7fff-79f7-68b2-70a7f3d5ba4a"><span>Business durable goods.</span><span> These are the goods that entrepreneurs need for the proper and successful functioning of their firms. Machinery and equipment are necessary to start specific types of businesses. Engines, metalworking machinery, and electrical transmission apparatus belong to industrial equipment that enables certain types of companies to operate. Commonly, firms need buses, cars, and trucks to transport goods necessary for production or to deliver products to their customers. Besides, business owners often need computers, laptops, smartphones, and tablets to control their business and track its success.</span></span></p>

  industrialProductionTotalIndex: `
  <p>The industrial production index (IPI) is a monthly economic indicator measuring real output in the manufacturing, mining, electric, and gas industries, relative to a base year.<br />It is published in the middle of every month by the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) and reported on by the Conference Board, a member-driven economic think tank. The FRB also releases revisions to previous estimates at the end of every March.</p>
<h5>How Does the Industrial Production Index (IPI) Work?</h5>
<p>The industrial production index (IPI) measures levels of production in the manufacturing, mining&mdash;including oil and gas field drilling services&mdash;and electrical and gas utilities sectors. It also measures capacity, an estimate of the production levels that could be sustainably maintained; and capacity utilization, the ratio of actual output to capacity.</p>
  `,
  totalVehicleSales: `
  <p>Motor vehicle sales represent the number of domestically produced units of cars, SUVs, minivans, and light trucks that are sold. Automobile manufacturers report their sales either quarterly or on the first business day of every month.<br />Motor vehicle sales are a key economic indicator since they provide a snapshot of consumer demand for big-ticket items. As a result, motor vehicle sales figures garner an enormous amount of attention.</p>
<h5>Understanding the Total Vehicle Sales</h5>
<p>The automotive industry is a key component of the U.S. economy. It remains the country's largest manufacturing industry, employing millions of people and contributing roughly 3% to total gross domestic product (GDP).</p>
<p>The auto industry directly employs more than two million people and spends billions of dollars each year on research and development (R&amp;D).<br />Autos make up a large chunk of consumer spending in the U.S. Consumers tend to purchase new autos when they are confident of their ability to afford ongoing payments and when interest rates for loans are relatively low.</p>
<p>An increase in motor vehicle sales can provide insight into the overall direction of the economy. When consumers are confident enough in their financial situation to purchase big-ticket items like autos, it tends to indicate that the economy is performing well. Equity markets respond favorably to positive economic growth indicators since it translates into higher corporate profits and higher stock prices.</p>

  retailMoneyFunds: `
  <p>A money market fund is a kind of mutual fund that invests in highly liquid, near-term instruments. These instruments include cash, cash equivalent securities, and high-credit-rating, debt-based securities with a short-term maturity (such as U.S. Treasuries). Money market funds are intended to offer investors high liquidity with a very low level of risk. Money market funds are also called money market mutual funds.</p>

Money market funds are intended to offer investors high liquidity with a very low level of risk. Money market funds are also called money market mutual funds.</p>
<p>While they sound similar in name, a money market fund is not the same as a money market account (MMA). A money market fund is an investment that is sponsored by an investment fund company. Therefore, it carries no guarantee of principal. A money market account is a type of interest-earning savings account. Money market accounts are offered by financial institutions. They are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and they typically have limited transaction privileges.</p>
<h5>How a Money Market Fund Works</h5>
<p>Money market funds work like a typical mutual fund. They issue redeemable units or shares to investors, and they are mandated to follow the guidelines drafted by financial regulators (for example, those set by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission).</p>
<p>A money market fund may invest in the following types of debt-based financial instruments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bankers' Acceptances (BA)&mdash;short-term debt guaranteed by a commercial bank</li>
<li>Certificates of deposit (CDs)&mdash;bank-issued savings certificate with short-term maturity</li>
<li>Commercial paper&mdash;unsecured short-term corporate debt</li>
<li>Repurchase agreements (Repo)&mdash;short-term government securities</li>
<li>U.S. Treasuries&mdash;short-term government debt issues</li>
</ul>
<p>Returns from these instruments are dependent on the applicable market interest rates, and therefore, the overall returns from the money market funds are also dependent on interest rates.</p>

  smoothedUSRecessionProbabilities: `
  <p dir="ltr">A smoothed recession probability is based on the most recent data available, and is thus potentially influenced by data that wasn&rsquo;t available the first time a recession probability for a particular month was calculated. Smoothed recession probabilities will be revised over time as additional data becomes available, and as initially released data is revised. The effect of these revisions is to &ldquo;smooth&rdquo; away some of the spikes in the recession probabilities that occur in real time.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">By contrast, a &ldquo;real-time&rdquo; recession probability is the first probability of recession that one could obtain for a given month. Note that the most recent smoothed probability is also a real-time probability.&nbsp;</p>
<h5 dir="ltr">How are these probabilities calculated?</h5>
<p dir="ltr">Monthly smoothed recession probabilities are calculated from a dynamic-factor Markov-switching (DFMS) model applied to four monthly coincident variables: non-farm payroll employment, the index of industrial production, real personal income excluding transfer payments, and real manufacturing and trade sales. This DFMS model was originally developed in Chauvet, M. &ldquo;An Econometric Characterization of Business Cycle Dynamics with Factor Structure and Regime Switches,&rdquo; International Economic Review, 1998.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The smoothed recession probabilities reported above are calculated from the DFMS model using Bayesian estimation techniques developed in Kim and Nelson (1998, Review of Economics and Statistics). Smoothed recession probabilities calculated from the same DFMS model, but using maximum likelihood estimation techniques are produced monthly by Marcelle Chauvet:</p>
